# Buckey
Buckey is an opensource, privacy oriented, configurable and hackable personal assistant.  
Because of it's privacy driven nature, it lacks some features that other commercial personal assistants boast (For example, good speech recognition)  


# Installation
Buckey relies on `SDL2`, `SDL_mixer`, `yaml-cpp`, `cppfs`,  `mimic1`, `pocketsphinx`, and `JSGF_Kit++`.

_Installation instrucions to come._
