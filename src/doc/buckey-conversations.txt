	\page buckey-conversations Conversations
	\p User interaction with Buckey is divided into two types:
    \li Commands
    \li Conversations

    Commands are based upon the Root JSGF Grammar stored in Buckey::rootGrammar. This Root Grammar is built from all of the enabled Modes and Services that Buckey has.
    
    Conversations are controlled by separate Modes. Each Mode can start and carry it's own Conversation that does not comply with the Root Grammar.
    Only one conversation may be occurring at a time (Modes must wait until the current conversation is over to start a new conversation).

    Text user input is treated as a Command if Buckey is not in a Conversation.

    Example of a command: 
    \li User: "buckey list enabled modes"

    Examples of a conversation:
    \li Mode: "Are you sure you want to do this?"
    \li User: "Yes"

    A Mode can try to start a conversation by calling Buckey::startConversation(). Buckey::startConversation() returns void and will not return until Buckey is able to start a conversation.
    Once a Mode is finished with a conversation, it must release it using Buckey::endConversation().
