	\page buckey-mode-vs-service Modes and Services
	\p Buckey is meant to a be a highly configurable and hackable personal assistant.
    The level of features added to Buckey by the user is controlled through Services and Modes.
    
    A Service provides a larger feature that can be used for many specific types of smaller features.

    A Mode provides a specific set of features.

    For example:
    \li Service: Text to speech
    \li Mode: Speaking the time of day to the user is a Mode
    \li Service: A GUI that the user can interact with
    \li Mode: Displaying a reference image in the GUI when the user requests it

    Services are meant to be larger "chunks" of features that may take more computational power. memory, and radically change Buckey's behaiour.
    Modes are meant to fill niche roles and give Buckey its usability and application in life and are generally smaller.
    
    At some point, Modes will be able to be created through scripting languages such as Python or JavaScript.
